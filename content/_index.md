We, the undersigned students, faculty, and staff of the Jackson School of Geosciences condemn the actions of Gov. Greg Abbott, President Jay Hartzell, University of Texas at Austin administration, and law enforcement officials on Wednesday, April 24th and Monday, April 29th, which represented a grave and dangerous violation of the principles of academic freedom and free speech. By asking for Texas State Trooper presence and authorizing Texas State Troopers to forcibly arrest nearly 60 peaceful student protesters, colleagues, and friends, President Hartzell has endangered students and undermined the very foundations of our academic community. The unwarranted arrest of student protestors not only disrupts their academic pursuits, and in many cases, threatens their visa status, but also sends a chilling message about the state of free expression within our university.

  
From our positions at the Jackson School of Geosciences, we know that the study of Earth science is fundamentally linked to issues of justice and policy and we therefore feel the need to speak out. We also recognize that the events in the Middle East of these past months are a difficult and often traumatic topic for many on campus and are subject to a wide range of views and emotions. Regardless of whether one agrees with the goals of the protests, however, we should agree that it is always unacceptable and inappropriate for the President of the University of Texas to bring armed and militarized police into our campus to use physical force against students and workers engaging in non-violent political action. We are thankful that no one was seriously injured in these events, but as we have seen throughout history, heavy and armed police presence on university campuses all too frequently can lead to disastrous outcomes. That President Hartzell thought it appropriate to bring in such forces to our campus shows his complete disregard for the safety of our university community.


As members of the Jackson School of Geosciences community we believe that it is our responsibility to speak out when the university denies our students the right to freely pursue their education or exercise their political rights. We stand firm for academic freedom and the right to protest at a time when such liberties are more precarious than ever. We stand firm with the Palestine Solidarity Committee at UT Austin and their freedom of expression and demand University administration and President Jay Hartzell to immediately reverse their suspension. We demand that communication and dialogue always take precedence over the use of police force when engaging with students participating in political action on UT Austinâ€™s campus. These events, among others that have been taking place over the last six months, directly impact the work that we all perform as scholars and teachers. Every statement, and action goes a long way. 
  
In Solidarity,                    
Concerned Students, Faculty, and Staff of the Jackson School of Geosciences, the University of Texas at Austin
